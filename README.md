## What is Eco Chart Pro?

## ‚ú® Key Features
Eco Chart Pro is packed with features designed to create a complete training ecosystem for traders.

### üîé High-Fidelity Replay Mode

### ‚úçÔ∏è In-Depth Guided Journaling

## For Developers: Build Your Own Edge

-   **Complete In-App Java Editor:** Write, compile, and hot-reload your code directly onto your charts. Features include syntax highlighting and API code completion.
-   **Stateful Indicator Support:** The API includes lifecycle hooks (`onSettingsChanged`, `onRemoved`) and a persistent `state` map, enabling the correct implementation of stateful indicators like EMAs and custom oscillators.
-   **Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Access:** Indicators can request data from higher timeframes within their calculation logic to analyze market structure.
