The Core Feedback Loop
Eco Chart Pro is built around four key pillars that work together to help you become a more disciplined and profitable trader.
üîé Backtest with Precision (Replay Mode)
Step through historical market data bar-by-bar in a high-fidelity simulated environment. Test your strategies against real market conditions without risking capital. The replay engine is the foundation of your practice.
‚úçÔ∏è Journal Every Decision
Go beyond simple P&L. For every trade, the guided journaling system prompts you to log your emotional state, plan adherence, setup quality, and any mistakes made. This creates a rich dataset of your trading behavior.
üí° Gain Actionable Insights
Turn your raw journal data into wisdom. The Coaching Service automatically analyzes your trading patterns to find recurring issues, time-based weaknesses, and hidden strengths. It's like having a personal trading coach reviewing your performance.
üèÜ Level Up Your Discipline (Gamification)
Stay motivated and build consistent habits with an integrated progression system. Earn Experience Points (XP) for disciplined trading, unlock achievements for reaching key milestones, and take on daily challenges to improve specific skills.
For Power Users & Developers
üîß Build Your Own Edge (Custom Indicators)
Go beyond built-in indicators. Eco Chart Pro features a complete in-app Java editor with code completion and an extensive API. Write, compile, and hot-reload your own custom indicators directly onto your charts without ever leaving the application.
üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap
This project is under active development. The roadmap is divided into several key phases focused on architectural improvements, feature expansion, and usability enhancements.
Phase 1: Core Architecture & UI Refinement
[In Progress] Polymorphic Drawing Tool Settings: Refactor the drawing tool settings logic to use a polymorphic approach, allowing each drawing tool to manage its own settings dialog for better extensibility.
[Planned] Info Cursor Tool: Introduce a new cursor mode that displays a detailed information panel about the candle and indicator values under the cursor.
[Planned] Right-Click Context Menus: Provide faster access to common actions (e.g., delete drawing, modify order) via context-sensitive right-click menus on the chart.
[Planned] Enhanced Chart Interaction: Implement zoom-to-cursor and click-and-drag axis scaling for a more fluid and intuitive chart navigation experience.
Phase 2: Advanced Analysis & Trading Features
[Planned] P&L Calculation Service: Refactor all unrealized P&L calculations into a dedicated, centralized service to ensure consistency and eliminate logic duplication.
[Planned] Drawing Tool Templates: Implement a system for users to create, save, and apply multiple named style templates for each drawing tool.
Phase 3: Live Data & Trading
[Planned] Multi-Source Data Integration: Expand data handling to support multiple live and historical data providers (e.g., Binance, OKX, Yahoo Finance), allowing users to select their preferred source.
[Planned] Live Data Integration: Connect the charting engine to live WebSocket data feeds for real-time market data.
[Planned] Live Trading Integration: Implement a TradingService for live brokerage APIs to enable real-money trading directly from the platform.
Phase 4: Usability & Polish
[Planned] Onboarding & Help System: Add a "Help" menu and an "About" dialog with application information and links to documentation.
